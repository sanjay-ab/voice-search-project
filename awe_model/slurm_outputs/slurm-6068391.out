Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /dev/shm/sanjayb_6068391/matplotlib-pk_nttwi because the default path (/home/tc062/tc062/sanjayb/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
